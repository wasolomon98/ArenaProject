# ArenaProject

Welcome to Arena Project, a tool designed to leverage the power of the internet computer to power a deFi game ecosystem that stores its data directly on the blockchain. The project aims to develop a game using microservices that alter and store each game session's state on the IC by allocating space within a collection of DAO-managed canisters adhering to game behavior rules. 

The project is still in the earliest stages of development. Check back regularly as new features are implemented and further described here.
