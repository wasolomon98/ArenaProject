# ArenaProject

Welcome to your new Arena Project, a tool designed to leverage the power of the internet computer. The project aims to develop a game using microservices that alter and store each game session's state on the IC. 

The project is still in the earliest stages of development. Check back regularly as new features are implemented and further described here.
